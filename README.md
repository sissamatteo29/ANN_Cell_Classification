# üß¨ White Blood Cell Classification using Neural Networks

This project aims to develop a neural network model to classify images of white blood cells into their respective categories. Accurate classification of white blood cells is a critical task in medical diagnostics, helping healthcare professionals detect and monitor various conditions, including infections, immune disorders, and leukemia.

## üß† Objective

The goal is to train a machine learning model‚Äîspecifically a convolutional neural network (CNN)‚Äîthat can automatically identify and classify white blood cells from microscopic images. The model should be able to distinguish between different cell types such as:

- Neutrophils  
- Lymphocytes  
- Monocytes  
- Eosinophils  
- Basophils  

## üîç Why This Matters

Manual classification of blood cells is time-consuming and subject to human error. Automating this process with neural networks can:

- Improve diagnostic speed and consistency  
- Assist medical professionals in large-scale screenings  
- Lay the foundation for AI-powered diagnostic tools in hematology

## üß™ Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains labeled images of white blood cells, typically collected using light microscopy. Each image is annotated with the correct cell type to train and evaluate the model.

## üìà Approach

- Preprocess the image data (resizing, normalization)
- Build and train a CNN for classification
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualize results using confusion matrices and sample predictions

## üî¨ Outcome

In the final report that can be find in the repository it is possible to check out the entire analysis that the team carried out on the results achieved in this project.
